**Python Text or PyText**
__By Omar Diaz__

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little project to test Python 2.x capabilities Including AppJar for GUI
making (http://appjar.info/) and some Tkinter for nice looking window function. 
The intended use is a straightforward, easy, reliable and of course a nice n'
really lightweight application with Python core to edit any type of file with 
UTF-8 encoding in them. Supposed to be portable, no install and Console ready 
in case you don't want the GUI editing. pyText best text!
